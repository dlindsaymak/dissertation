Start Date,End Date,Response Type,IP Address,Progress,Duration (in seconds),Finished,Recorded Date,Response ID,Recipient Last Name,Recipient First Name,Recipient Email,External Data Reference,Location Latitude,Location Longitude,Distribution Channel,User Language,"Project Description: You are being invited to participate in a research study designed to measure behavioral intentions to mitigate climate change. This study is being done by Debra Lindsay & Dr. Karen Dobkins from the University of California - San Diego (UCSD). You have been asked to be in this study because you are a student at UCSD who can receive SONA credit for participating.

 

What will happen: The purpose of this research study is to determine people’s behavioral intentions to conduct pro-climate behavior and their emotional involvement with those actions. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete an online survey. This survey will present you with several scenarios in which you can act to reduce your emissions and ask your intentions to act on these as well as your emotional response to taking action. It will also ask you some basic demographic questions as well as your current beliefs about human-induced climate change. It will take you approximately 15 minutes to complete. 

 

Benefits: There may or may not be any direct benefit to you from this research. The investigators, however, may learn more about what behavioral intentions people have towards reducing their personal carbon emissions.

 

Risks: There is a small risk of feeling frustrated, fatigued or bored, but you can stop, or take breaks, at any time. There is also the risk that you may feel uncomfortable because some of the questions in the survey may bring up negative emotions. If so, you may call UCSD Counseling and Psychological Services at (858) 534-3755. Because this is a research study, there may also be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings. 

 

Confidentiality: All confidential and personally identifying information (e.g. email addresses, IP addresses) can only be accessed by the researchers on the study via a password-protected account on Qualtrics. Any identifying information that is collected (e.g. IP addresses, email addresses) will be removed from the data as soon as it is downloaded to prevent accidental breaches of confidentiality with this information.

 

Participation: Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time by simply exiting the survey. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. 

 

Compensation: For completing this survey, you will receive 0.5 SONA credit. There are no costs associated with being in this study.

 

Who to contact with questions: If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact Debra Lindsay at dlindsay@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UCSD Human Research Protections Program Office at 858-246-HRPP (858-246-4777).

First set was based on the premise that the subject chose to make these changes based on their own volition. The second set was based on the premise that the government mandated these changes. One distinction I think would help is if you clarified if the government mandate has as much power as the mask mandate, like shops and organizations have to follow it but you still get trouble makers who don't go with it, or if the government mandate can go as far as fining and jailing you for not following the mandate?

An issue I noticed was you put the same sub-text for reducing air travel for leisure and air travel for work in the government mandated section of the survey. The reducing air travel for leisure section describes a scenario of traveling for meetings, the same scenario you wrote for work.

My last issue and my strongest issue with your survey is that you did not include Taiwan as an option in your demographic questions near the end of the survey. I do hope that it was not a politically charged decision to omit Taiwan as an option. Do know that there are almost a million Taiwanese people in America. If you want to use this survey for a larger sample of the American public you will not get an accurate demographic response from Taiwanese people who cannot choose Taiwan as an option.

For the most part, great work- it was easy to understand and complete.
I have a serious issue with framing these decisions as choices that an individual is responsible for. I would have no issue with government mandates on many of these things IF alternatives or incentives accompanied these policy changes. I would love to be able to drive less, fly less, use less plastic, and install renewable energy in my home. Unfortunately, the conditions around me make these changes difficult or impossible. I am not well-served by public transit for the drives I typically make. We do not have rail systems to reduce domestic air travel. The grocery stores in my area do not provide bulk options, and many of the foods I rely on due to affordability and ease of preparation are packaged in single-use plastic. As a renter, I have no control over my home's power, and even if I did I wouldn't be able to afford the installation. Facilitating these changes requires structural change in order to enable the average working person to live sustainably. In summary- I think a section with a similar question structure asking about attitudes towards making these changes if an alternative or incentive was provided would provide very useful data for the subject of this study.

Also, reducing online express shipping purchases is another possible change that I feel is just as impactful as reducing personal air travel/driving/clothing purchases.

Finally, I wish there had been a checkbox format for motivation behind changes rather than ""select one"" buttons. Many of these behavior changes for me were motivated by multiple factors, and I think it's important to distinguish those. For example, I reuse many single-plastic and glass containers not just because the production of them contributes to climate change, but because disposing of them increases non-climate related environmental damage, and because it saves me money on tupperware. Other changes are motivated by primarily for ethical considerations for humans and animals, like reducing animal product consumption and boycotting clothing made in sweatshops, but secondarily by climate concerns and tertiarily by financial concerns.",25,64,Compliance First,26812
