abstract: Connection to Nature (CTN) is a deeply held identity that includes nature in the self. Recent studies suggest a multi-dimensional structure; however, the dimensional structure is still unclear. We propose four dimensions to describe CTN - 1) A deeply held spiritual identity; 2) the experiential relationship with nature; 3) an emotional relationship with nature; and 4) mindful engagement with nature. This poster presents the results of two studies which validate these dimensions. Study 1 suggests a four-dimensional structure using exploratory factor analysis (n = 1,152). Study 2 confirms this using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 341), suggesting a four-dimensional structure has better fit (RMSEA = 0.07, 95%CI = 0-0.9) than a unidimensional structure (RMSEA = 0.10, 95%CI = 0 - 0.9). We also show convergent validity with Connectedness to Nature (Mayer & Frantz, 2004) (r­_deep = .73**, r_exp = .57**, r_emo = .45**, r_pres = .46**), Environmental Identity (Clayton et al., 2021) (r­_deep = .61**, r_exp = .77**, r_emo = .54**, r_pres = .50**), and predictive validity with pro-environmental behaviors (r_deep = .46**, r_exp = .39**, r_emo = .45**, r_pres = .42**).
