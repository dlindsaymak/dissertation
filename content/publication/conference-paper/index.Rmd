abstract: "Connection to Nature (CTN) is a deeply held identity that includes nature in the self. Recent studies suggest a multi-dimensional structure; however, the dimensional structure is still unclear. We propose four dimensions to describe CTN - 1) A deeply held spiritual identity; 2) the experiential relationship with nature; 3) an emotional relationship with nature; and 4) mindful engagement with nature. This poster presents the results of two studies which validate these dimensions. Study 1 suggests a four-dimensional structure using exploratory factor analysis (n = 1,152). Study 2 confirms this using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 341), suggesting a four-dimensional structure has better fit (RMSEA = 0.07, 95%CI = 0-0.9) than a unidimensional structure (RMSEA = 0.10, 95%CI = 0 - 0.9). We also show convergent validity with Connectedness to Nature (Mayer & Frantz, 2004) (r­_deep = .73**, r_exp = .57**, r_emo = .45**, r_pres = .46**), Environmental Identity (Clayton et al., 2021) (r­_deep = .61**, r_exp = .77**, r_emo = .54**, r_pres = .50**), and predictive validity with pro-environmental behaviors (r_deep = .46**, r_exp = .39**, r_emo = .45**, r_pres = .42**)."

# Background

There have been many iterations of a Connection to Nature (CTN) measure (see Ives et al., 2017, Restall & Conrad, 2015, and Tam 2013 for review).
Several of these measures have proposed multi-dimensional structure [@davis2011; @dong2020; @hatty2020; @kurth2020; @meis-harris2021; @olivos2011], however there is little consistency across these dimensional structures.
We build upon two recently published measures [@hatty2020 and @meis-harris2021], which ground their dimensional structure in a thorough cross-disciplinary review of the nature connectedness literature.
We extend their findings by addressing concerns that measures of CTN are vulnerable to self-report biases.
In particular, concerns have been raised that people may be more likely to endorse CTN items out of social desirability or may simply not be able to express the abstract concept of connection to nature when asked directly [@gould2021].
A possible solution to these issues is proposed by the Disposition to Connect with Nature measure which asks about people’s bonding behavior with nature instead of simply asking about preferences to being in nature [@brügger2011].
We adapted items from the Multi-dimensional CTN scale [@meis-harris2021] and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale [@brügger2011] as well as including several items that we felt addressed the concerns raised about self-report bias.

Across the three exploratory factor analyses, four factors consistently arose as both the best fitting model and aligning with our theoretical framework.
We further tested these four factors in a confirmatory factor analysis with a fourth sample and found adequate fit.
The dimensions include:

1.  Deep (deeply seeing the self as part of nature)
2.  Experiential (spending and enjoying time in nature)
3.  Emotional (Emotional desire to connect with nature and protect it.)
4.  Presence (engaging mindfully and consciously with nature)

# Selecting Initial Items

## Search of existing scales

An extensive search of the literature was conducted to source all existing adult measures of CTN.
Based on this search, we identified two measures that showed promise for further adaptation: The AIMES Multidimensional CTN Scale [@meis-harris2021] and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale [@brügger2011].
Our search identified that a multi-dimensional structure should be maintained for the measure, however existing multi-dimensional measures showed conflicting dimensional structure.
(@hatty2020 & @meis-harris2021 - the later having a more complex and theoretically driven dimensional structure which is why it was chosen to retain for adaptation).
The Disposition to Connect with Nature scale addressed issues of self-report bias though given it was written for a European sample the items were not generalizable to other populations.
The items from these two scales resulted in a total of 59 items (AIMES = 19 items; Dispositional CTN = 40 items).
Items were reworded for generalizability and clarity.
Any reference to “connection to nature” was removed to avoid concerns about participants not fully understanding this concept.
Items were also removed if they were redundant.
This left a total of 39 items adapted from existing measures (AIMES = 17 items; Dispositional CTN = 28).
See Table 1 below for all items considered for inclusion in the DEEP Connection to Nature Scale.

## Development of new items

We chose to build upon the strong theoretical basis for the dimensional structure of the AIMES with some changes.
@meis-harris2021 based the dimension of the AIMES (Affection, Identity, Materialism, Experience, & Spirituality) off @ives2018 which lists five aspects of human-nature relationships that can lead to behavioral change.
We agree with that three of these dimensions are part of the construct of CTN (these are also widely agreed to be part of the construct of CTN in the literature):

1.  Experiential (time spent in nature)
2.  Cognitive (beliefs about the self’s relationship with nature)
3.  Emotional (affective relationship with nature).

However, they included two value-based dimensions which, while strongly correlated to CTN, have been defined as separate constructs [@schwartz1992; @schwartz1999; @schultz2001; @stern1994]:

4.  Material values towards nature (viewing nature as a resource for human extraction e.g., extrinsic values)
5.  Philosophical views of nature (viewing humans as interrelated with nature e.g., universal values)

We chose to remove the the material dimension entirely and adapt the philosophical dimension so it more accurately reflected the individual level of CTN.
That is, it measured one’s own beliefs about how, as an individual, they are connected to nature.
In line with this re-analysis of the construct of CTN we further adapted the existing 39 items and created an additional 14 items in order to capture the following dimensions of CTN:

1.  Experiential
2.  Cognitive
3.  Emotional
4.  Spiritual (formerly philosophical)

Items were created to capture, behavioral, embodied, and experiential relationships with nature (in line with Brügger et al., 2011’s Disposition to CTN) in order to overcome concerns with self-report bias.
This resulted in items that asked about conscious attendance to nature.
There was also an effort to create items that updated previous philosophical items to more individual relationships with nature which tapped into a more spiritual relationship.
This resulted in a total of 58 items.

# Exploratory Factor Analysis

Two general population Prolific samples and one student sample were collected from November 2022 until April 2023 (See Table 2 for details of these samples)Three exploratory factor analyses were conducted on these samples.

## Items Removed

Several items were removed in sample 1 before the EFA was conducted.
These items were also excluded from samples 2 and 3.
Five items were removed due to high collinearity

A test for overdetermination revealed that the model may be overdetermined due to high colinearity between items (det \<.00001).
Inspection of the correlations revealed five items with highly colinearity (see Table 2).
The decision was made to remove AIMES_15, AIMES_7, and AIMES_2.
However, removing these items did not improve the risk of overdetermination (det \<.00001).

Further assumptions were explored to see if other items should be removed.
A Bartlett’s test of sphericity found there was adequate shared variance between items (𝜲2 = 17044.9(1225), p \<.001).
A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.97).
However, exploration of individual items identified three items which may not have sufficient variance: DISPO_32, DISPO_38, & DISPO_36 (MSA = 0.89, MSA = 0.82, & MSA = 0.84 respectively).
Inspection for ceiling and floor effects confirms this, as well as identifying several other items that may have limited variance (See Figure 1).
Several items also appeared to have high positive or negative skew (See Figure 2).
Several items were removed due to high skewedness (NEW_9, DISPO_38, DISPO_39, DISPO_6, & DISPO_36).
A final check of overdetermination revealed there is still the potential for the fit to be overdetermined (det \<.00001).

Sample 2

A test for overdetermination revealed that the model may be overdetermined due to high colinearity between items (det \<.00001).
Inspection of the correlations no items with highly colinearity. 

Further assumptions were explored to see if other items should be removed.
A Bartlett’s test of sphericity found there was adequate shared variance between items (𝜲2 = 8385.44(703), p \<.001).
A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.95).
Exploration of individual items showed that no single item was \< .80.
Inspection of box plots and histograms of distribution showed not items with ceiling/floor effects or high skewedness.

Sample 3

A test for overdetermination revealed that the model may be overdetermined due to high colinearity between items (det \<.00001).
Inspection of the correlations no items with highly colinearity. 

\
Further assumptions were explored to see if other items should be removed.
A Bartlett’s test of sphericity found there was adequate shared variance between items (𝜲2 = 8353.44(73), p \<.001).
A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.95).
Exploration of individual items showed that no single item was \< .80.
Inspection of box plots and histograms of distribution showed not items with ceiling/floor effects or high skewedness.
