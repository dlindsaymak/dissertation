<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>There have been many iterations of a Connection to Nature (CTN) measure (see Ives et al., 2017, Restall &amp; Conrad, 2015, and Tam 2013 for review).
Several of these measures have proposed multi-dimensional structure <span class="citation">(Davis, Le, and Coy 2011; Dong et al. 2020; Hatty et al. 2020; Kurth et al. 2020; Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021; Olivos and Aragonés 2011)</span>, however there is little consistency across these dimensional structures.
We build upon two recently published measures <span class="citation">Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021)</span>, which ground their dimensional structure in a thorough cross-disciplinary review of the nature connectedness literature.
We extend their findings by addressing concerns that measures of CTN are vulnerable to self-report biases.
In particular, concerns have been raised that people may be more likely to endorse CTN items out of social desirability or may simply not be able to express the abstract concept of connection to nature when asked directly <span class="citation">(Gould and Schultz 2021)</span>.
A possible solution to these issues is proposed by the Disposition to Connect with Nature measure which asks about people’s bonding behavior with nature instead of simply asking about preferences to being in nature <span class="citation">(Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011)</span>.
We adapted items from the Multi-dimensional CTN scale <span class="citation">(Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021)</span> and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale <span class="citation">(Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011)</span> as well as including several items that we felt addressed the concerns raised about self-report bias.</p>
<p>Across the three exploratory factor analyses, four factors consistently arose as both the best fitting model and aligning with our theoretical framework.
We further tested these four factors in a confirmatory factor analysis with a fourth sample and found adequate fit.
The dimensions include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Deep (deeply seeing the self as part of nature)</li>
<li>Experiential (spending and enjoying time in nature)</li>
<li>Emotional (Emotional desire to connect with nature and protect it.)</li>
<li>Presence (engaging mindfully and consciously with nature)</li>
</ol>

<div id="search-of-existing-scales" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Search of existing scales</h2>
<p>An extensive search of the literature was conducted to source all existing adult measures of CTN.
Based on this search, we identified two measures that showed promise for further adaptation: The AIMES Multidimensional CTN Scale <span class="citation">(Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021)</span> and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale <span class="citation">(Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011)</span>.
Our search identified that a multi-dimensional structure should be maintained for the measure, however existing multi-dimensional measures showed conflicting dimensional structure.
(<span class="citation">Hatty et al. (2020)</span> &amp; <span class="citation">Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021)</span> - the later having a more complex and theoretically driven dimensional structure which is why it was chosen to retain for adaptation).
The Disposition to Connect with Nature scale addressed issues of self-report bias though given it was written for a European sample the items were not generalizable to other populations.
The items from these two scales resulted in a total of 59 items (AIMES = 19 items; Dispositional CTN = 40 items).
Items were reworded for generalizability and clarity.
Any reference to “connection to nature” was removed to avoid concerns about participants not fully understanding this concept.
Items were also removed if they were redundant.
This left a total of 39 items adapted from existing measures (AIMES = 17 items; Dispositional CTN = 28).
See Table 1 below for all items considered for inclusion in the DEEP Connection to Nature Scale.</p>

<div id="development-of-new-items" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Development of new items</h2>
<p>We chose to build upon the strong theoretical basis for the dimensional structure of the AIMES with some changes.
<span class="citation">Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021)</span> based the dimension of the AIMES (Affection, Identity, Materialism, Experience, &amp; Spirituality) off <span class="citation">Ives et al. (2018)</span> which lists five aspects of human-nature relationships that can lead to behavioral change.
We agree with that three of these dimensions are part of the construct of CTN (these are also widely agreed to be part of the construct of CTN in the literature):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experiential (time spent in nature)</li>
<li>Cognitive (beliefs about the self’s relationship with nature)</li>
<li>Emotional (affective relationship with nature).</li>
</ol>
<p>However, they included two value-based dimensions which, while strongly correlated to CTN, have been defined as separate constructs <span class="citation">(Schwartz 1992, 1999; Schultz 2001; Stern and Dietz 1994)</span>:</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Material values towards nature (viewing nature as a resource for human extraction e.g., extrinsic values)</li>
<li>Philosophical views of nature (viewing humans as interrelated with nature e.g., universal values)</li>
</ol>
<p>We chose to remove the the material dimension entirely and adapt the philosophical dimension so it more accurately reflected the individual level of CTN.
That is, it measured one’s own beliefs about how, as an individual, they are connected to nature.
In line with this re-analysis of the construct of CTN we further adapted the existing 39 items and created an additional 14 items in order to capture the following dimensions of CTN:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Experiential</li>
<li>Cognitive</li>
<li>Emotional</li>
<li>Spiritual (formerly philosophical)</li>
</ol>
<p>Items were created to capture, behavioral, embodied, and experiential relationships with nature (in line with Brügger et al., 2011’s Disposition to CTN) in order to overcome concerns with self-report bias.
This resulted in items that asked about conscious attendance to nature.
There was also an effort to create items that updated previous philosophical items to more individual relationships with nature which tapped into a more spiritual relationship.
This resulted in a total of 58 items.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Items Removed</h2>
<p>Several items were removed in sample 1 before the EFA was conducted.
These items were also excluded from samples 2 and 3.
Five items were removed due to high collinearity</p>
<p>A test for overdetermination revealed that the model may be overdetermined due to high colinearity between items (det &lt;.00001).
Inspection of the correlations revealed five items with highly colinearity (see Table 2).
The decision was made to remove AIMES_15, AIMES_7, and AIMES_2.
However, removing these items did not improve the risk of overdetermination (det &lt;.00001).</p>
<p>Further assumptions were explored to see if other items should be removed.
A Bartlett’s test of sphericity found there was adequate shared variance between items (𝜲2 = 17044.9(1225), p &lt;.001).
A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.97).
However, exploration of individual items identified three items which may not have sufficient variance: DISPO_32, DISPO_38, &amp; DISPO_36 (MSA = 0.89, MSA = 0.82, &amp; MSA = 0.84 respectively).
Inspection for ceiling and floor effects confirms this, as well as identifying several other items that may have limited variance (See Figure 1).
Several items also appeared to have high positive or negative skew (See Figure 2).
Several items were removed due to high skewedness (NEW_9, DISPO_38, DISPO_39, DISPO_6, &amp; DISPO_36).
A final check of overdetermination revealed there is still the potential for the fit to be overdetermined (det &lt;.00001).</p>
<p>Sample 2</p>
<p>A test for overdetermination revealed that the model may be overdetermined due to high colinearity between items (det &lt;.00001).
Inspection of the correlations no items with highly colinearity. </p>
<p>Further assumptions were explored to see if other items should be removed.
A Bartlett’s test of sphericity found there was adequate shared variance between items (𝜲2 = 8385.44(703), p &lt;.001).
A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.95).
Exploration of individual items showed that no single item was &lt; .80.
Inspection of box plots and histograms of distribution showed not items with ceiling/floor effects or high skewedness.</p>
<p>Sample 3</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Number of Factors</h2>
<p>Despite the potential for overdetermination, an EFA was conducted using a principal analysis method of extraction. This method has been found to be robust with models with non-normal data (Briggs &amp; MacCullum, 2003). The Psych package in R was used with a promax rotation and principal analysis factoring method.</p>
<p>The number of factors to be extracted was estimated using both a scree plot and parallel analysis. The screen plot suggested ~3-4 factors, while parallel analysis suggested 6 factors across all three samples</p>
<p>[insert plots here from all three samples]</p>
<p>Four models were run across all three samples:
* Six factors
* Five factors
* Four factors
* Simplified four factors (removing dual loading and poor loading items from four factor model)</p>

<p>The simplified 4-factor model may be still be overdetermined: determinant &lt; 0.00001, even though we have removed items with high covariance.</p>
<p>Tests of shared variance between items and variance within items both suggest the data is suitable for factor analysis.
Sample 1 - Bartlett’s test of sphericity showed a 𝜲2 = 3171.39(595), p &lt;.001). A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.97).
Sample 2 - Bartlett’s test of sphericity showed a 𝜲2 = 6674.74(406), p &lt;.001). A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.95).
Sample 3 - Bartlett’s test of sphericity showed a 𝜲2 = 6674.74(406), p &lt;.001). A Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test of factor adequacy found that, overall, there was adequate variance within items (MSA = 0.95).</p>
<p>We calculated several fit indices and found that the simplified four-factor model was an appropriate fit across all three samples. While the full four-factor model, shows better fit according to these indices. We chose to keep the simplified factor due to the full four factor model including items that cross loaded.</p>
<p>The root mean square error of the approximate (RMSEA) should aim for &gt; 0.05. The root mean square of the residuals (RMSR) should be close to 0. The Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) aims for scores &gt; 0.9. The Baysean Information Criteria (BIC) should be smaller and more negative.</p>

<p>394 undergraduate students participated for course credit in May 2023. Thirty-one participants did not complete the study and twenty-two people failed to pass attention checks so their data was not analysed. The final analysis consisted of 341 participants with ages ranging from 18 - 42 (M = 20.88, SD = 2.7). The same was primarily made up of females (68.3%) and people of Asian ethnicity (42.1%). See the table below for full descriptive statistics. Political Ideology was scored on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = Most Conservative and 7 = Most Liberal. The mean political ideology was 5.04(1.17), showing that this sample skewed more liberal. This is to be expected with our student sample.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.1</span> Items Removed</h3>
<p>Several assumptions need to be met before running a confirmatory factor analysis. We identified that no item had a high inter-correlation &gt; .75. Next, we checked the skewedness and kurtosis of each item to be included in the CFA. The closer to zero for both skewedness and kurtosis, the closer to a normal distribution. Any items whose distributions exhibited skewness and/or kurtosis that exceed general guidelines were considered non-normal removed from the analysis (Hair et al., 2017, p. 61).</p>
<p>For skewedness, using the skewness function from the Moments package in R (Komsta &amp; Novemstky, 2015), skewness was calculated for each item. Any item where the number is greater than +1 (right skewed) or lower than -1 (left skewed), this is an indication of a substantially skewed distribution. No items were heavily skewed in this dataset.</p>
<p>For Kurtosis, using the kurtosis function from the Moments package in R (Komsta &amp; Novemstky, 2015), kurtosis was calculated for each item. Any item were the number is greater than +3, the distribution is too peaked. Likewise, a kurtosis of less than -3 indicates a distribution that is too flat. Two items showed high kurtosis: “I have great respect for being alive on this earth and part of the universe” and “Listening to the sounds of nature makes me relax” and were removed from the CFA.</p>
<p>[insert kurtosis figure]</p>
<p>A Mardia Test of multivariate normality from the MVN package in R (Korkmaz et al., 2021) indicated that this data is not normal, suggesting that a rotation-method that is robust to non-normal data should be used (Mardia Skewedness = 7681.36, p &lt; .001 and Mardia Kurtosis = 28.32, p &lt; .001).</p>

<p>We assessed the convergent validity of the new DEEP CTN scale, that is how closely our new measure is related to other established measures of the same construct. We tested this by looking at the zero order correlation between our new measure and its subscales and two established measures: The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS - Mayer &amp; Franz, 2004) and the Environmental Identity Scale revised (EID-R - Clayton et al., 2021). A zero-order correlation found moderate-strong correlation between existing CTN scales and the new subscales of the DEEP CTN scale. See table below:</p>

<p>Two measures of predictive validity were used: Pro-environmental behavior &amp; three subscales of the primal beliefs invetory - the world is interconnected, the world is heirarchical, and the world is about me.</p>
<p>Participants completed the Recurring Pro-environmental Behavior scale (Brick et al., 2017) which asks people to report how often they engage in various pro-environmental behaviors. This scale includes 20 items measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(never) to 5(always).</p>

The Hierarchical subscale consists of five questions exploring beliefs about the hierarchical nature of the world (e.g., Things are rarely equal.

All items are measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 6(strongly agree).</p>
<p>We assessed the predictive validity of the new DEEP CTN scale (i.e., how well our measure can predict participant scores on two theoretically related constructs). The “gold standard” for predictive validity of CTN measures is how well it predicts pro-environmental behavior (PEB) (Clayton, 2003; Clayton et al., 2021; Mayer &amp; Frantz, 2004; Tam, 2013). A zero-order correlation found moderate correlations between PEB and the new subscales of the DEEP CTN scale. See table below:</p>
<p>[insert table]</p>
<p>A linear regression with only the subscales of CTN predicting PEB showed that Deep, Emotional, and Presence were adequate to predcict PEB, but not Experiential.</p>
<p>[insert table &amp; effect sizes]</p>
<p>We also suspected that DEEP CTN and its subscales would predict three types of primal world beliefs (Clifton et al., 2019): That the world is interconnected, that the world is not hierarchical, and that the world is not about me (i.e., less egocentric worldviews). A zero-order correlation found weak -moderate correlations between interconnected beliefs and the new subscales of the DEEP CTN scale. We also found weak correlations between egocentric beliefs and the Deep, Presence, and Overall CTN. No relationship was found between any subscale and hierarchical worldviews. See table below:</p>

<div id="incremental-validity" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Incremental Validity</h2>
<p>We explored if the DEEP CTN scale and its facets would perform above and beyond existing CTN scales (i.e., CNS and EID-R) when predicting PEB. A linear regression model was run, which included the dimensions of the DEEP CTN scale and the existing CTN measures (CNS and EIDR) were entered simultaneously to predict PEB. Note that because overall CTN was highly intercorrelated with Deep and Emotional, it was left out and only the four dimensions were included.</p>
<p>We found that the Emotional and Presence subscales remained significant predictors when existing measures of CTN were entered into the model. The Deep subscale was no longer a significant predictor. Both our subscales were of equal predictive value compared to the existing measures.</p>
