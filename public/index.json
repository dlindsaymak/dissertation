Likewise, a kurtosis of less than –3 indicates a distribution that is too flat.\nThree items with slightly high Kurtosis:\nDEEPCTN_s_5\n“I have great respect for being alive on this earth and part of the universe”\nDEEPCTN_ex_7\n“Listening to the sounds of nature makes me relax”\nDEEPCTN_em_5\n“I am careful to not step on snails”\nInter-item Correlation None are strongly ( \u0026gt;.75) correlated so no need to remove any\nMultivariate normality Notes on Multivariate Normality Quantiative test of normality: shapiro is fine for univariate normality test. But I also need to test for multivariate normality. This package is both. Use this. Can just look at univariate for now, but REPEAT THIS with my final variables to check for multivariate normality Sources: Lavaan Package notes MVN Package Notes How to perform multivariate normality tests in R How to transform data in R Using the Mardia Test of multivariate AND univariate normality. Mardia test shows that my data is not normal.
