Several of these measures have proposed multi-dimensional structure (Davis, Le, and Coy 2011; Dong et al. 2020; Hatty et al. 2020; Kurth et al. 2020; Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021; Olivos and Aragonés 2011), however there is little consistency across these dimensional structures. We build upon two recently published measures Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021), which ground their dimensional structure in a thorough cross-disciplinary review of the nature connectedness literature. We extend their findings by addressing concerns that measures of CTN are vulnerable to self-report biases. In particular, concerns have been raised that people may be more likely to endorse CTN items out of social desirability or may simply not be able to express the abstract concept of connection to nature when asked directly (Gould and Schultz 2021). A possible solution to these issues is proposed by the Disposition to Connect with Nature measure which asks about people’s bonding behavior with nature instead of simply asking about preferences to being in nature (Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011). We adapted items from the Multi-dimensional CTN scale (Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021) and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale (Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011) as well as including several items that we felt addressed the concerns raised about self-report bias.\nAcross the three exploratory factor analyses, four factors consistently arose as both the best fitting model and aligning with our theoretical framework. We further tested these four factors in a confirmatory factor analysis with a fourth sample and found adequate fit. The dimensions include:\nDeep (deeply seeing the self as part of nature) Experiential (spending and enjoying time in nature) Emotional (Emotional desire to connect with nature and protect it.) Presence (engaging mindfully and consciously with nature) Selecting Initial Items Search of existing scales An extensive search of the literature was conducted to source all existing adult measures of CTN. Based on this search, we identified two measures that showed promise for further adaptation: The AIMES Multidimensional CTN Scale (Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen 2021) and the Disposition to Connect with Nature scale (Brügger, Kaiser, and Roczen 2011). Our search identified that a multi-dimensional structure should be maintained for the measure, however existing multi-dimensional measures showed conflicting dimensional structure. (Hatty et al. (2020) \u0026amp; Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021) - the later having a more complex and theoretically driven dimensional structure which is why it was chosen to retain for adaptation). The Disposition to Connect with Nature scale addressed issues of self-report bias though given it was written for a European sample the items were not generalizable to other populations. The items from these two scales resulted in a total of 59 items (AIMES = 19 items; Dispositional CTN = 40 items). Items were reworded for generalizability and clarity. Any reference to “connection to nature” was removed to avoid concerns about participants not fully understanding this concept. Items were also removed if they were redundant. This left a total of 39 items adapted from existing measures (AIMES = 17 items; Dispositional CTN = 28). See Table 1 below for all items considered for inclusion in the DEEP Connection to Nature Scale.\nDevelopment of new items We chose to build upon the strong theoretical basis for the dimensional structure of the AIMES with some changes. Meis-Harris, Borg, and Jorgensen (2021) based the dimension of the AIMES (Affection, Identity, Materialism, Experience, \u0026amp; Spirituality) off Ives et al. (2018) which lists five aspects of human-nature relationships that can lead to behavioral change. We agree with that three of these dimensions are part of the construct of CTN (these are also widely agreed to be part of the construct of CTN in the literature):\nExperiential (time spent in nature) Cognitive (beliefs about the self’s relationship with nature) Emotional (affective relationship with nature). However, they included two value-based dimensions which, while strongly correlated to CTN, have been defined as separate constructs (Schwartz 1992, 1999; Schultz 2001; Stern and Dietz 1994):\nMaterial values towards nature (viewing nature as a resource for human extraction e.g., extrinsic values) Philosophical views of nature (viewing humans as interrelated with nature e.g., universal values) We chose to remove the the material dimension entirely and adapt the philosophical dimension so it more accurately reflected the individual level of CTN. That is, it measured one’s own beliefs about how, as an individual, they are connected to nature.

This was piloting the CFA that will be run on Prolific participants Jan 2024.\nParticipants 394 undergraduate students participated for course credit in May 2023. Thirty-one participants did not complete the study and twenty-two people failed to pass attention checks so their data was not analysed. The final analysis consisted of 341 participants with ages ranging from 18 - 42 (M = 20.88, 2.7). The sample was primarily made up of females (68.3%) and people of Asian ethnicity (42.1%).

The mean political ideology was 5.04(1.17), showing that this sample skewed more liberal. This is to be expected with our student sample. Family SES was scored on a 10-point ladder,with 10 being the best off, and 1 being the worst off. The mean SES was 6.3(1.72).\nMethod Participants enrolled in undergraduate psychology courses signed up via SONA to participate in a short online study for course credit. They were directed to a Qualtrics survey where they were first prompted with the question “How would you define nature?”. After which they were presented with 30 CTN items. These were the CTN items selected after analysing the results from the EFA studies above. See [ADD LINK HERE] for a full list of CTN items.\nMeasures Convergent Validity\nTwo pre-existing CTN scales were used to identify convergent validity. The Connectedenss to Nature Scale (CNS, Mayer \u0026amp; Frantz, 2004) and the Environmental Identity Scale revised (EID-R, Clayton et al., 2021). The CNS is a 14-item scale designed to measure the cognitive beliefs about how interneconnect one’s self is to nature. It is measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 5(strongly agree). The EID-R is a 14-item scale designed to measure how interneconnect one’s self is to nature. It is measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(not at all true of me) to 7(completely true of me).\nPredictive Validity\nPro-environmental behavior\nParticipants completed the Recurring Pro-environmental Behavior scale (Brick et al., 2017) which asks people to report how often they engage in various pro-environmental behaviors. This scale includes 20 items measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(never) to 5(always).\nPrimal Beliefs\nThree subscales of the primals beliefs inventory (Clifton et al., 2019) were used to identify worldviews held by participants. The About Me subscale consists of five questions asking how egocentric ones beliefs are (e.g., Whatever is happening around me often feels related to me or something I’ve done). The Hierarchical subscale consists of five questions exploring beliefs about the hierarchical nature of the world (e.g., Things are rarely equal. Most plants and animals, even people, are better or worse than one another.). The Interconnected subscale consists of four items asking how connected or atomistic one believes the world to be (e.g., Most things are basically unconnected and independent from each other [reversed]). All items are measured on a Likert scale ranging from 1(strongly disagree) to 6(strongly agree).\nCovariates\nLocus of Control\nParticipants completed a brief version of the Locus of Control Scale (Sapp \u0026amp; Harrod, 1993) which includes 9 items revealing how much people perceived they have internal control over events (e.g., To a great extent, my life is controlled by accidental happenings). Measured on a Likert scale from 1(strongly disagree) to 7(strongly agree).\nDemographics\nParticipants also answered several demographics questions (age, gender, political ideology, and social economic status).\nAnalysis \u0026amp; Results CFA Assumptions Several assumptions need to be met before running a confirmatory factor analysis. First we checked the skewedness and kurtosis of each item to be included in the CFA. The closer to zero for both skewedness and kurtosis, the closer to a normal distribution. Any items whose distributions exhibited skewness and/or kurtosis that exceed general guidelines were considered non-normal removed from the analysis (Hair et al., 2017, p. 61).

In either case this would suggest it’s important to include as a covariate.\nThis resulted in including the following covariates:\nPolitics (r = .19** with PEB \u0026amp; r = .18** to .23** with DEEP CTN dimensions)\nPrimal Beliefs - The world is interconnect (r = .21** with PEB \u0026amp; r = .22** to .38** with DEEP CTN dimensions)\nA multiple linear regression model where dimensions of the DEEP CTN scale and existing CTN measures (CNS and EIDR) and the covariates (politics \u0026amp; primal belief interconnectedness) were entered simultaneously to predict PEB is reported in the table below.\nBy adding the covariates, both Emotional and Prescence subscales remained significant predictors of PEB\nvariable\nPartial R2\np\nstd Beta*\nlower_bound\nupper_bound\ndeep_ctn_z\n0.03\n0.60\n-0.04\n-0.20\n0.12\nexp_ctn_z\n0.03\n0.15\n-0.13\n-0.29\n0.04\nemo_ctn_z\n0.07\n0.00\n0.23\n0.11\n0.36\npresc_ctn_z\n0.05\n0.01\n0.17\n0.04\n0.30\nCNS_Z\n0.06\n0.00\n0.24\n0.09\n0.39\nEIDR_Z\n0.06\n0.02\n0.21\n0.04\n0.39\nPI_connect_Z\n0.01\n0.50\n-0.04\n-0.15\n0.07\npolitics\n0.02\n0.10\n0.09\n-0.02\n0.20\n*\u0026lt; 0.29 = small; 0.30-0.49 = medium;\n\u0026gt; 0.50 = large\nTotal variance explained by the model = 0.33\nComparing Incremental and Robust models Adding robust variables did not improve the fit of the model …","date":1706227200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706227200,"objectID":"7169b4c136303523ee5d1a772fe79377","permalink":"https://debsdissertation.netlify.app/post/peb_validity_sp23_reduced/","publishdate":"2024-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/peb_validity_sp23_reduced/","section":"post","summary":"Pilot data collected during the Spring quarter (2023) on SONA students.
